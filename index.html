      <h2>• Research •</h2>
      <h3>Interviews</h3>
      <p>We conducted 5 user research interviews, and found Apple Music and Spotify were our biggest competitors in terms of music listening/streaming. Songkick was listed as an indirect competitor but could technically be a direct competitor with the concert tracking feature. After we had chosen this app idea, a few of our team members received notifications from Spotify that they essentially were doing the same thing! We continued to move forward with our app creation, though in a real life scenario, we might have had to rethink our features.
      </p>
      <h3>Surveys</h3>
      <p>In addition to our interviews, we deployed a survey via social media for some initial information to begin our project. We received 59 responses from the survey.</p>
        <p>Results from our surveys said:</p>
        <p>59% of respondents have not used collaborative playlists but would be interested</p>
        <p>67% of respondents are very interested in discovering local musicians</p>
        <p>68% of survey respondents are interested in connecting with other music lovers in their area </p>

        <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
        <p>We derived our Diagram from the results of our User Interviews.</p>
        <div class="affinityDiagram"><img src="images/Unison Affinity Diagram.jpg"></div>
        <h3>User Insight</h3>
        <p>Individuals who listen to music need an easier way to connect with other people who have similar interests because they are curious about what others are listening to.

          During research interviews and surveys, we discovered that people prefer live music and are interested in connecting with other music lovers in their area.
          
          Therefore, we believe that small intimate group chats with fellow music lovers would be beneficial when planning to attend a live music event and that we might be able to help if we develop an app that connects music listeners with others going to the same live event.
          </p>
        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>From our user research, we created a user persona. This is Stanley Cheng. His goals are to make friends with people who have the same music interests, and to see live performances without queues. However, if he does decide to go to a live show, one of his pain points would be that he doesn’t want to go by himself.</p>

        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <img src="images/Unison Competitor Analysis.png">
        <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
        <p>We prioritized features by participating in a I Like, I Wish, What If exercise based on the key takeaways brought forth from the research interviews and affinity diagram. We then added the top features to a Feature Prioritization Matrix which allowed us to categorize the features into the HOW, NOW, WOW meaning which items were necessary to add now, which features would be great to have Wow, and then which features were a bit more complicated in the How section.
        </p>
        <h3>Storyboard</h3>
        <p>Stanley has no plans for the evening. He feels bored and sad. He would like to go see live music since he hasn't been able to go to a show in a long time.</p>
        <p>Stanley does a Google search for "live music in my area" and begins seeing ads on his social media for Unison. Stanley downloads and signs up for the Unison app.</p>
          <p>Stanley browses what shows are happening in his area, and finds a local musician he would be interested in seeing.</p>
            <p> Stanley joins the live chat in the music room of the local musician he found.</p>
              <p> Stanley finds another music lover who is interested in this local artist, and arranges to meet up and go see the live show tonight.</p>
                <p>  Stanley and his new friend have a great time at the show and are able to keep in touch to see future shows together.</p>

      <h3>User Flow</h3>
      <p>Our user flow shows how the user would go from creating an account and onboarding through the app. From navigating to the Live Shows section and connecting with others interested in the same event to the next half of the app, the Listening Parties/chat section.</p>

      <p>Initial usability tests showed that some of the screens were unclear so we added “directions” or updated copy so it was more clear. The initial wireframe also had a lot of drawers when they might not have been needed.</p>
